    <h2>Life Complimnets</h2>
    <p1>To success in life... You need two things... Ignorance and Confidence...
        I’m born to express, not to impress.
        Hard Work + Dream + Dedication = Success.
        My life ,my rule,that’s my attitude…
        Smile and the world smiles with you.
        Life is like a camera. . so face it with a SMILE
